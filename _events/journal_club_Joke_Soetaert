We are excited to announce our second journal club by MS patient expert Joke Soetaert!
Joke will talk about the perspective of people with MS on AI.
Their needs will guide AI development, which is why you should definitely attend!

### Introducing the speaker
Joke Soetaert has been pursuing her dream job as a midwife in neonatology and maternity for seven years, where she thrives on hands-on patient care. Prior to that, she worked for five years as a nurse in the operating room. During her transition to her current role, she noticed the first symptoms of what was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis in 2019. She immediately felt a strong need for medical knowledge, delving into the scientific literature while also participating as a subject in several research studies in Belgium and the Netherlands.
In 2021, she began volunteering as the coordinator of the youth program at MS-Liga Vlaanderen, a community fostering positive peer connections and providing information to young people with MS up to 35 years old and their environment.

For the past four years, she has also served as an MS patient expert, applying her professional medical background and personal experience in collaborations with MS professionals, pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders.
She is a member of patient advisory boards in several hospitals around the country. Additionally, she participates in (inter)national conferences such as ECTRIMS to stay up to date with the latest developments in the MS field, and last year presented her first abstract and poster at the EMSP congress in Prague, focusing on the patient perspective of MS and comorbidities.
